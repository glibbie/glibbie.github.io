We all love this esport. Some of us more than others. I was, and still am, a huge fan of CS:GO and although it’s harder these days to find the time to sit down and watch an entire tournament, I still love to chuck on a game in the background while I’m working. There have been some great matches at the EPL Season 7 finals but ESL’s decision to sign an exclusive broadcasting deal with Facebook has left many fans visibly disappointed with the lack of features, difficulty in finding games and drop in quality compared to the standard of Twitch. 

**“Fans don’t pay to watch CS:GO tournaments. They shouldn’t complain. It’s not like they’re paying customers.”**

This type of rhetoric has been touted by a number of on-screen talents in CS:GO, Thorin is one of them. He posted this on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lol at fans who are against PPV, hate broadcast rights being sold to anyone who isn&#39;t twitch (incl. youtube) and overwhelmingly use adblock imagining they are &quot;the customer&quot; of tournament streams.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FanLogic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FanLogic</a></p>&mdash; Thorin (@Thooorin) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thooorin/status/997226372404785152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2018</a></blockquote>

To understand why the argument against fans voicing their descent at the Facebook deal doesn’t work we must talk about what drives the economy of esports. The answer is simply ‘fans’. Viewers, people who watch and cheer for their favourite team, who buy gaming equipment simply because the world’s best player is on the box, drive esports. 

Corporations in esports spend millions of dollars on sponsorships and marketing to try and convince those viewers that they should buy their products. Everyone knows your deagle ability increases 10 fold if you’re using the same mouse as Niko right? 

These companies try and convince viewers to buy their gear or use their service or what have you. They sponsor tournaments and teams in order to get the most eyeballs on their branding or product. The more viewers (usually) means the more sales. It’s in every company’s best interest for the most amount of people to watch a tournament that they are sponsoring otherwise why are they sponsoring it at all?

Viewers buy gaming products. Manufacturers of said products invest more money into esports sponsorships to get the more sales. More sponsorship money for tournament organisers (TOs) like ESL means more investment in tournaments which leads to more viewers. It’s this cycle which has led to the explosion of esports in the last few years. 

So no, Thorin, fans are customers. Even if they use adblock. Many spend hundreds of dollars a year on merchandise and travel across the globe to attend live events. Viewers are absolutely customers. Without fans there is no esports. It’s sounds cliche because it’s true. 

Are fans then justified in boycotting this event or watching the Russian stream purely because it’s on Twitch? Yes. Facebook live is simply an inferior platform. Here’s why.

60 FPS. Facebook doesn’t have it. Twitch does, Youtube does, but Facebook does not. That alone is enough for me to not want to watch a CS:GO stream. Video games are so much faster paced compared to real life content which Facebook usually broadcasts. I use a 144hz monitor in game so 60 FPS for viewing is a minimum. While Twitch and Youtube are pushing the bar, Facebook is stuck behind. Whether you can stand to watch CS:GO with less than 60 FPS is a personal conclusion. 

Of the more subjective shortfalls are a lack of Twitch chat and no rewind feature as seen on Youtube. These may not bother some people but I do personally enjoy the ‘virtual crowd’ feeling of Twitch chat when someone makes a sick play or wins an important clutch. 

There are a number of more differences between these platforms and I could go on and on. My criticisms of Facebook are certainly mirrored by other CS:GO enthusiasts with viewership taking a hit compared to tournaments on Twitch with a similar stature. Facebook does not disclose accurate viewer numbers so I will not attempt to quantify the dip although we can assume the vocal discontent with Facebook from the community and the difficulty of finding where games are being shown has resulted in a decreased viewer count. 

I obviously don’t have enough knowledge to decide if the exclusivity deal for the EPL finals was a net-positive or a net negative for ESL. I don’t have a copy of the contract nor am I a member of ESL’s financial department, however, I will say this. ESL continuing to put out a subdued product lacking in quality by selling their exclusive broadcast rights to the highest bidder while not taking into account the standard of the platform they are signing with will not bode well for ESL.

The Viewer-Sponsor-TO economy will start receding if more viewers switch off. Less viewers means less sponsor money which means less money for ESL. Exclusivity deals may seem fantastic for TOs in the short term but at what cost? Does ESL really want to sell out their long term growth for short term economic gain? 

All this being said, some of the posts about ESL and Facebook live have been a bit over the top. The EPL finals are not unwatchable. If you truly want to watch it then you can do so. 

It was also disappointing to see the community by-and-large reject Youtube into the sphere a few months ago the same way it has done to Facebook. Youtube gaming has made a much better attempt to treat fans with a well rounded and high quality service instead of  just cashing in on the esports epidemic like Facebook is doing today. 

One of the qualities that Youtube Gaming had from day one was the aforementioned rewind and live pause feature. I can think of a number times I’ve needed to take a piss during an important round but had to wait until an eco instead of being able to pause the stream and go straight away. Yeah, this problem isn’t the worst thing in the world but being able to pause and rewind is a good ‘nice to have’. 

The community must distinguish between genuine attempts to break into the scene, like Youtube, and half-hearted money grabs like Facebook. The more platforms providing high quality streams is better for everyone. It’s better for the fans because competing platforms push each other to improve and it’s better for TOs because a better product means more eyes and thus more investments/sponsorships. 

So dear CS:GO fans, if you really want to improve esports, criticise a poor product when it’s actually poor. Praise a good product when it’s actually good.
